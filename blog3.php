          <p>
            Digital transformation is the key to remain competitive in the industry and rack up your footing in the market place. The Insurance Sector is no exception.
          </p>
          <p>
            And in the Indian market place, to drive a successful digital transformation for increased ROI, it is imperative for insurers to look past Business Process Management (BPM) in the traditional way. For instance, during the preface, BPM for insurance was anticipated to supervise the backend operations as an integration layer only.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, today insurers are moving past the traditional BPM capabilities, tapping into its deep-rooted potential by integrating Analytics, Machine Learning, RPA, Digital Sensing, etc. This has fueled expectations with the BPM market to thrive at a rapid pace of 12.2% for the Middle East, Asia Pacific, and African markets in the last few years.

              <p>
                With the passage of time, the BPM models in the insurance sector have become fragmented across different geographies, leading to duplicate process flows and overlapping functions.
              </p>
              <p>This has led numerous disconnected systems to operate within an enterprise channeling inefficiency in monitoring across different application interfaces.</p>
              <p>Consequently, this has marked the need for an integrated view of operations and the importance of effective BPM implementation across the insurance industry.</p>
              <p>Hence, BPM for insurance experts is not just the need of the hour, it is obligatory too.</p>
            

              <h5>Challenges Persisting in the Insurance Industry</h5>
              <p>Insurance products are serviced by different application systems and process implementations, and hence share a plethora of following challenges for which BPM for insurance becomes inevitable:</p>
              <ul class="ml-4">
                  <li>Cross-selling options are restricted in the absence of a unified process platform which BPM for insurance processes promise.</li>
                  <li>Unstructured method of communication leading to repetitive manual procedures and lowered productivity levels.</li>
                  <li>Lack of transparency in the process cycle</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The challenges mentioned above point out the need for a more rigorous process management approach.</p>
              <p>BPM for insurance tools and technologies like process automation, workflow management, business process reengineering, and business activity monitoring is the only way for insurers to deal with such looming challenges in their industry.</p>
              <p>Here is a detailed overlook as to why BPM is the ideal application platform for the insurance sector.</p>

              <h5>BPM as an Application Platform</h5>
              <p>As per market experts, BPM platform is the perfect podium to create systematic business applications that permit customizations as per the requirements.</p>
              <p>Let’s understand this with an instance of BPM for insurance.</p>
              <p>Today, an application can be submitted via a host of methods like online portals, kiosks, agent networks, Social Media, etc. This calls for the front-end application to be vigorous plus flexible to manage multi-channel initiation to flow smoothly via data extraction points and conduct duplicity checks.</p>
              <p>Since there is a considerable number of manual operations involved, RPA integrated with BPM methodology can play a very symbolic role here. Thanks to business process management capabilities, transactional applications can be configured to accommodate recurrent changes very conveniently.</p>
              <p>Add to it, intelligent BPM solutions help insurers to stay ahead in the competition by promising a praiseworthy and exclusive customer experience to severely cut down the customer acquisition cost, reduce the attrition rate, and foster loyalty.</p>

              <p>In addition to it, a BPM platform also facilitates the following for the insurance sector:</p>
              
              <ul class="ml-4">
                  <li>Optimized policy processing</li>
                  <li>A higher level of service to client-targeted policyholders</li>

              <h5>Key benefits of a BPM platform for the Insurance Industry</h5>

              <p>Here are the key benefits of the intelligent BPM for insurance:</p>
              <ul class="ml-4">
                  <li><strong> Business Processes- </strong>Thanks to effective BPM implementation, the centralization of key insurance processes, which were previously isolated (like claims processing, underwriting, policy servicing, etc.) is possible for seamless flow of data to cater to the millennial customers.</li>
                  <li><strong>Leveraging the Evolving Technologies- </strong>Insurers can leverage BPM solutions to make the most of the potential of the new age technologies, by integrating them with RPA.</li>

As per market survey reports, more than 80 percent of satisfied customers renew their policies,as compared to the unsatisfied ones. "</p></blockquote>
